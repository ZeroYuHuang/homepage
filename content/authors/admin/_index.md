Hi! I'm Zeyu Huang (黄泽宇 in Chinese). I am now a graduate student in Beihang University, co-supervised by [Prof.Zhang Xiong](http://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/2637.htm) and [Prof. Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/). I received my BSc of Information and Computing Science from Beihang University in 2020. Currently, I am looking for professor willing to receive me as PhD student.  Please email me if you have interests.

My research interests lies at the intersection of Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing.  Presently, since Large-scale Pretrained Language Models has boosted AI's performance in both NLP and CV, I am working on ***Editing***  and ***Mining***  diverse knowledge from them and enabling the practical application of them to be more convenient.
